<p class="p">The topic 
<a class="xref" href="02_intro.html" title="Introduces the algorithm for optimization of a mixed integer program (MIP) in a distributed computing environment.">Distributed optimization of MIPs: the algorithm</a>
outlined the algorithm underlying distributed parallel MIP in CPLEX. </p>
<p class="p">This topic continues the description of distributed parallel MIP by distinguishing 
the special characteristics of distributed parallel 
branch and bound from conventional branch and bound algorithms in shared memory.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Search tree</h2>
<p class="p">Distributed parallel branch and bound is similar to conventional, shared-memory branch and bound. 
They differ greatly, however, in their management of the search tree.  In a conventional, 
shared-memory branch and bound, the search tree resides on a single machine, on disk or in 
shared memory. In contrast, distributed parallel branch and bound literally distributes 
the search tree across a cluster of machines.</p>

<p class="p">In the CPLEX implementation of distributed parallel branch and bound, the master keeps a 
number of nodes of the global search tree. If a worker becomes idle, the master sends some 
of those nodes to that worker. The worker then starts branch and bound on those nodes. 
However, the worker does <strong class="ph b">not</strong> simply solve a node, create some new nodes in doing so, 
and send them all back to the master.  Instead, the worker considers the search tree node 
received from the master as a new MIP. The worker presolves that MIP and finds an optimal 
solution for that node using branch and bound.  In other words, a worker not only solves a 
single node; in fact, the worker solves an entire subtree rooted at that node.</p>

<p class="p">While this distributed parallel branch and bound algorithm is running, the master can 
ask a worker to provide some open nodes (that is, unsolved nodes). The master can then 
use these nodes to assign work to idle workers. To satisfy such a request from the master, 
a worker picks a few open nodes from its current tree. Because the current tree in a worker 
is a subtree of the global tree (indeed, it is the subtree rooted at the node sent to the 
worker), every node in that subtree is also a node in the global tree. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stopping criterion</h2>
<p class="p">The distributed parallel branch and bound algorithm stops if all the nodes of the global search tree 
have been processed or if it reaches a limit set by the user.  Such limits include a time limit, 
a limit on the number of nodes processed, a limit on the number of solutions found, or other similar 
criteria.</p>
